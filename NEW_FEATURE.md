# 🆕 New Feature: Pre-Interview Configuration

## What's New?

Users can now optionally fill out a configuration form **before** starting their interview! This feature:

✅ **Prevents Redundant Questions** - The AI interviewer won't ask about information you've already provided
✅ **Customizes Your Experience** - Tailor the interview to your subject, year, and topics
✅ **Saves Time** - Skip preliminary questions and get straight to the interview
✅ **Completely Optional** - You can skip the form and start immediately if you prefer

## Quick Demo

### Before (Old Flow)

```
🎤 Interview starts
Interviewer: "What subject are you studying?"
You: "Computer Science"
Interviewer: "Which year are you in?"
You: "3rd year"
Interviewer: "What topics would you like to cover?"
You: "Data Structures..."
Interviewer: "Now let's begin with the questions..."
```

### After (New Flow)

```
📋 Configuration Form appears
You fill: Subject: Computer Science, Year: 3rd Year, Topics: Data Structures
🎤 Interview starts
Interviewer: "Hello! I see you're a 3rd year CS student focusing on Data Structures. Let's jump right into the questions..."
```
